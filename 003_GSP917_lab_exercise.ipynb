Additional factors to consider in practice when using CLV to inform interventions include customer acquisition costs, profit margins, and discount rates to arrive at the present value of future customer cash flows. One of a DNN's benefits over traditional probabilistic modeling approaches is their ability to incorporate additional categorical and unstructured features; this is a great feature engineering opportunity to explore beyond this lab which just explores the RFM numeric features."

With this small dataset, it is recommended to remove these outlier customer values to treat separately, change your model's loss function to be more resistant to outliers, log the target feature, or clip their values to a maximum threshold.
